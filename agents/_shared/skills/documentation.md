# Technical Documentation

Write clear, maintainable technical documentation for different audiences and purposes.

## Document Types

### README
- What this is and why it exists
- Quick start (< 5 minutes to first success)
- Configuration and usage
- Contributing guide

### API Documentation
- Endpoint reference with request/response examples
- Authentication and error codes
- Rate limits and pagination
- SDK examples

### Runbook
- When to use this runbook
- Prerequisites and access needed
- Step-by-step procedure
- Rollback steps
- Escalation path

### Architecture Doc
- Context and goals
- High-level design with diagrams
- Key decisions and trade-offs
- Data flow and integration points

### Onboarding Guide
- Environment setup
- Key systems and how they connect
- Common tasks with walkthroughs
- Who to ask for what

## Principles

1. **Write for the reader** — Who is reading this and what do they need?
2. **Start with the most useful information** — Don't bury the lede
3. **Show, don't tell** — Code examples, commands, screenshots
4. **Keep it current** — Outdated docs are worse than no docs
5. **Link, don't duplicate** — Reference other docs instead of copying

### Codebase refactor (Phases 1–5) — COMPLETED

Package reorganization (`analysis/`, `generators/`, `reporters/`, `tools/`, `integrations/` + backward-compat re-exports); CLI and chat command registries (`cli/registry.py`, `chat/slash_registry.py`); Explore agent (15) + `SubagentDispatcher`; `BashTool` for shell execution; slimmer chat REPL (`chat_state.py`, `chat_delegation.py`, `chat_repl.py`, `chat_skill_runner.py`).
